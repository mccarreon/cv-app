# CV Generator

**LINK TO LIVE VERSION**: https://mccarreon.github.io/cv-app/

My first React app! It's a simple CV-generator similar to Linkedin's profile page. 

Users can add their personal info, education info, and their relevant job experience. 

Used materialui for styling.
## Goals of project
